# im_working
Python script to simulate you are working.

Do you ever stand from your computer just to take a walk or drink coffee 
and worry about anyone thinking you are procrastinating?

Never again. Run this script and let them think you are just waiting for something to finish :D

It reads a random log file in a logs folder and prints the first lines of it 
and then starts a progress bar with a small random wait time, just for realism ;)

Enjoy.
